# Checklist

This checklist is here to **help you feel confident that your project meets all the expectations.** You can refer back to it as you build your page and mark items off as you complete them. The steps don’t need to be followed in a specific order, just make sure everything is included in the end. Most importantly, your final design should closely match the mockup, both on desktop and mobile screens.

### Structure and Content

* [ ] Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
* [ ] Include a navigation bar with the WaveRiders logo and links: About, Courses, Shop, Contact
* [ ] Add a hero section with a large heading, subtitle, and a “Book your lesson” button
* [ ] Display a background image of waves in the hero section
* [ ] Include a gallery section with two images of surfing squirrels
* [ ] Add an about section explaining why to choose WaveRiders, with three feature blocks (icon, title, description)
* [ ] Include a testimonials section with three short customer reviews inside styled cards
* [ ] Add a footer with navigation links, social media icons or emojis, contact information, and a Google Map embedded using `<iframe>`

### &#x20;Layout and Styling

* [ ] Use **Flexbox or Grid** for layout across all main sections (navigation bar, hero, about, testimonials, footer)
* [ ] Match the font, colors, and spacing from the mockup design
* [ ] Add **hover effects** to footer links or icons
* [ ] Use **card-style boxes** (e.g. border, shadow, background) for testimonials
* [ ] Make sure the footer stays at the bottom of the page and never overlaps content

### Accessibility and Semantics

* [ ] Use appropriate HTML tags and structure for meaning, not just appearance
* [ ] Add `alt` text to all images for accessibility
* [ ] Keep content organized and readable with clear headings and sections

### Responsive Design & CSS Best Practices

* [ ] Use responsive units (`%`, `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw`) — avoid large fixed pixel values (especially over 50px)
* [ ] Use media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens
* [ ] Make sure elements stack vertically on mobile when needed (e.g. gallery images, about features, testimonials)
* [ ] Ensure text scales properly and remains readable on all screen sizes
* [ ] Test the layout using your browser’s responsive view (e.g. CodePen preview or DevTools)
* [ ] The final result should match the design closely on **both desktop and mobile**



Super! :tada: Now that you have completed everything in this checklist and your page matches the design, you’re ready to move on to the next step: recording your project overview video.
